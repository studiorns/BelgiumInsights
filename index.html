                <ul>
                    <li>The 0.28 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 2.8%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with relatively low efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive but weak (just below 0.3).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI but with lower efficiency than in markets like France (0.35) or Germany (0.42).</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce modest growth.</li>
                    <li>The low elasticity suggests that the Belgium market is less responsive to media campaigns, and other factors significantly influence travel decisions.</li>
                    <li>This low responsiveness suggests that media investments should be complemented by other marketing approaches, such as addressing specific barriers to visitation and leveraging partnerships with Belgian travel operators.</li>

                <h5>Strategic Example:</h5>
                <p>If you're planning to increase media impressions by 20% for a campaign, you can expect approximately a 5.6% increase in travel queries (20% × 0.28 = 5.6%). This helps set realistic expectations for campaign performance and ROI calculations.</p>

                <h5>Business Implications:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The perception of "restrictive laws and customs" remains the top barrier (44%), indicating a need for educational marketing that clarifies misconceptions about local regulations and customs.</li>
                    <li>The significant increase in the perception that there is "not much to do" (+20pp) is particularly concerning and suggests a failure to effectively communicate Abu Dhabi's diverse offerings to the Belgian market.</li>
                    <li>Value perception has deteriorated, with "not value for money" increasing by 11pp to 34%, despite the perception of being "too expensive" decreasing by 13pp. This suggests that while price sensitivity may be decreasing, Belgians are questioning what they get for their money.</li>
                    <li>The emergence of "no direct flights" as a barrier (from 0% to 13%) indicates a practical obstacle that should be addressed through airline partnerships or better communication about convenient connecting options.</li>
                    <li>The increase in "already visited before" (+16pp) could be interpreted positively as indicating growth in visitation, but also suggests a need for marketing that highlights new attractions and experiences to encourage repeat visits.</li>
                    <li>The decrease in "other places I would rather visit" (-12pp) is positive, suggesting Abu Dhabi is becoming more competitive in the consideration set.</li>
                    <li>The perception of being "not authentic enough" remains high at 29%, indicating a need for marketing that showcases authentic cultural experiences and local heritage.</li>

                <p>Develop a multi-faceted campaign specifically for the Belgian market that addresses the top barriers: (1) Create educational content that clarifies misconceptions about local laws and customs, emphasizing the welcoming nature of Abu Dhabi for international visitors; (2) Showcase the diversity of activities available, particularly highlighting cultural attractions that align with Belgian interests; (3) Emphasize value-for-money aspects by creating content that demonstrates the quality and uniqueness of experiences relative to cost; (4) Partner with airlines to improve flight connectivity or create package deals that make the journey more convenient and affordable; and (5) Highlight authentic cultural experiences that counter the perception of artificiality.</p>
